## Plotting results

We have used gnuplot scripts to plot all results. <br>
1. The folder `gnuplot-scripts/Mw` has scripts that plots the data as a function of the molecular weight of dendrons. <br> 
2. Wheras the folder `gnuplot-scripts/Conc` has scripts that plots the data as a function of the relative concentration of dendrons.
