Replacing old mdp entry 'nstxtcout' by 'nstxout-compressed'

NOTE 1 [file npt_5fs_short_test.mdp]:
  You have set rlist larger than the interaction cut-off, but you also have
  verlet-buffer-tolerance > 0. Will set rlist using verlet-buffer-tolerance.

Setting the LD random seed to 1674744146
Generated 0 of the 780 non-bonded parameter combinations
Excluding 1 bonded neighbours molecule type 'DEN'
Excluding 1 bonded neighbours molecule type 'DPPC'
Excluding 1 bonded neighbours molecule type 'W'
Removing all charge groups because cutoff-scheme=Verlet
Analysing residue names:
There are: 192188      Other residues
Analysing residues not classified as Protein/DNA/RNA/Water and splitting into groups...
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group DEN is 39428.83
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group DPPC is 97271.59
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group W is 567444.56
Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 323 K
Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.203 nm, buffer size 0.003 nm
Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.200 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm
Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Reading Coordinates, Velocities and Box size from old trajectory
Will read whole trajectory
Last frame         -1 time 469098.406   
Using frame at t = 469098 ps
Starting time for run is 0 ps
This run will generate roughly 24 Mb of data

Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 9.5%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 13%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 1.2%.


NOTE: 94 % of the run time was spent communicating energies,
      you might want to use the -gcom option of mdrun
