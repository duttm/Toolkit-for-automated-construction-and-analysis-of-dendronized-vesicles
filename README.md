# Toolkit-for-automated-construction-and-analysis-of-dendronized-vesicles
This is a toolkit which enables the automated creation and analysis of dendronized vesicles.

# Workflow layout

1. [Simulation-Setup](Simulation-Setup): A high-throughout framework to launch all simulations in parallel

2. [Analysis_Packages](Analysis_Packages):  Analyze simulation outputs with an in-house objected-oriented python package

3. [HPC-to-local-machine](HPC-to-local-machine): Transfer files from multiple HPC resources to a local drive

4. [Create-Data-Structure](Create-Data-Structure): Store all files in a well-defined database

5. [Data-Wrangling-1](Data-Wrangling-1): Collect results for all the measurements

6. [Data-Wrangling-2](Data-Wrangling-2): Create a single csv file containing all the results

7. [Plots](Plots): Plot results using gnuplot

8. [Image-render](Image-render): Create a high-throughput framework to generate vesicle images
